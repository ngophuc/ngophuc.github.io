Since Sep. 2014, I joined <a href=https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/>Université de Lorraine</a> as an associate professor. More precisely, I do my teaching at Computer Science departement of the <a href=https://fst.univ-lorraine.fr/>Faculté des Sciences et Technology (FST)</a> Nancy. Also, I am a member of <a href=https://adagio.loria.fr/>Adagio team</a> of <a href=https://www.loria.fr>LORIA</a>.

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Image, Processing and Tomography Lab of <a href=https://www.cea.fr/paris-saclay/Pages/Accueil.aspx>CEA-Saclay</a>. I was working on a project about volumic accelerated reconstruction algorithm in X-ray tomography for early osteoarthrisis diagnostic, low dose and low cost.

I received my PhD in Oct. 2013 from <a href=https://www.paris-est-sup.fr/>Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée (UPEMLV)</a>. My thesis is entitled <strong>Rigid transformations on 2D digital images: Combinatorial and topological analysis</strong>, and was carried out in the A3SI team of the [Laboratoire d’<a href=https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/>Informatique Gaspard Monge (LIGM)</a> at <a href=https://www.esiee.fr/>ESIEE-Paris</a>, under the supervision of <a href=https://kenmochi.users.greyc.fr>Yukiko Kenmochi</a> and <a href=https://hugues-talbot.github.io/>Hugues Talbot</a> and <a href=http://crestic.univ-reims.fr/membre/1542-nicolas-passat>Nicolas Passat</a>.

My research topic is in the area of <strong>Discrete Geometry and Topology</strong>, applied for <strong>Computer Vision and Image Analysis</strong>. I focus in particular on geometric transformations (rigid motions, affine transformations, ...) and the combinatorial structure modelling the parameter space of such transformations on arbitrary finite subset of Z2/Z3.

I am also interested in <strong>Tomographic Imaging</strong>, and my post doctoral project was on 3D reconstruction algorithms based on sparse reconstruction with TV regularization in X-ray tomography (CT).
</p>

<p align="justify">
I am currently working on <strong>Digital Curve Analysis</strong>. More precisely, I study the geometrical characteristics of noisy digital contours using the discrete structures such as maximal segment, blurred segment, tangential cover.
I am also working on subjects related to <strong>Wood Image Analysis</strong> such as pith detection, wood-log segmentation and wood defect detection.
