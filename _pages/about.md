Since Sep. 2014, I joined [Université de Lorraine](https://www.univ-lorraine.fr/) as an associate professor. More precisely, I do my teaching at Computer Science departement of the [Faculté des Sciences et Technology (FST)](https://fst.univ-lorraine.fr/) Nancy. Also, I am a member of [Adagio team](https://adagio.loria.fr/) of [LORIA](https://www.loria.fr).

Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at Image, Processing and Tomography Lab of [CEA-Saclay](https://www.cea.fr/paris-saclay/Pages/Accueil.aspx). I was working on a project about volumic accelerated reconstruction algorithm in X-ray tomography for early osteoarthrisis diagnostic, low dose and low cost.

I received my PhD in Oct. 2013 from [Université Paris-Est Marne-la-Vallée (UPEMLV)](https://www.paris-est-sup.fr/), France. My thesis is entitled **Rigid transformations on 2D digital images: Combinatorial and topological analysis**, and was carried out in the A3SI team of the [Laboratoire d’Informatique Gaspard Monge (LIGM)](https://siteigm.univ-mlv.fr/) at [ESIEE-Paris Engineering](https://www.esiee.fr/) school, under the supervision of Prof. [Yukiko Kenmochi](https://kenmochi.users.greyc.fr) and [Hugues Talbot](https://hugues-talbot.github.io/) and [Nicolas Passat](http://crestic.univ-reims.fr/membre/1542-nicolas-passat).

My research topic is in the area of **Discrete Geometry and Topology**, applied for **Computer Vision and Image Analysis**. I focus in particular on geometric transformations (rigid motions, affine transformations, ...) and the combinatorial structure modelling the parameter space of such transformations on arbitrary finite subset of Z2/Z3.

I am also interested in **Tomographic Imaging**, and my post doctoral project was on 3D reconstruction algorithms based on sparse reconstruction with TV regularization in X-ray tomography (CT).

I am currently working on **Digital Curve Analysis**. More precisely, I study the geometrical characteristics of noisy digital contours using the discrete structures such as maximal segment, blurred segment, tangential cover.
I am also working on subjects related to **Wood Image Analysis** such as pith detection, wood-log segmentation and wood defect detection.
